Welcome to Sumo2Unity
===================================

Introduction
-------

**Sumo2Unity** is an open-source project that integrates the capabilities of SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) and Unity,
a powerful 3D game engine. This integration bridges the gap between microscopic traffic simulation and real-time 3D visualization,
enabling you to:

* **Visualize**: 
   Immerse yourself in a 3D environment that accurately reflects the
   simulated traffic network created in SUMO.
* **Analyze**: 
   Gain deeper insights into traffic behavior by observing and interacting
   with the simulation in real-time.
* **Develop**: 
   Leverage the combined power of SUMO and Unity to create custom applications for various purposes,
   such as training autonomous vehicles, evaluating traffic management strategies, and designing
   safer and more efficient transportation systems.

**SUMO**, a microscopic and continuous multi-modal traffic simulation package, offers a comprehensive suite of
features for modeling complex transportation systems, including:

* Road vehicles, public transport, and pedestrians
* Route finding, visualization, network import, and emission calculation
* Remote control and customization through various APIs

Unity provides a robust and user-friendly platform for creating interactive 3D experiences. 
By combining the strengths of these two powerful tools, Sumo2Unity empowers you to bridge 
the gap between simulation and visualization, opening doors to innovative research, development, 
and educational applications in the field of transportation.
